# Java_GUI_2_Swing
The purpose of this repo is dive deeper into how I can incorporate OOP with GUIs

This project involves using: 
```
1. Java Swing (To generate GUI for Event Handling)
2. All inputs are randomly generated
```
## GUI Interface:
```
1. 12 JButtons are created, representing 12 different countries

2. Each country will be given a random score from 10 Judges ranging from 0 - 100 each. (Max score: 1000)

3. Data for each country will be kept in their own respective instances
   - Country Name
   - Array of Score (Size 10)
   - Total Score from all 10 Judges
   - Rank of country according to Total Score

4. After user clicks on a country, Country flag will shift right & Rank of that country will be displayed in the same JButton

5. A JOptionPane will appear showing the details of all countries. For example: 
   - Rank 1. Spain (808.89)
   - Rank 2. Brazil (771.31)
   - Rank 3. Germany (693.52)
```
